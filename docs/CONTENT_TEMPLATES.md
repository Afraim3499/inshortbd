The U.S. Senate passed a sweeping $500 billion infrastructure bill Wednesday, Dec. 7, in a bipartisan 68-32 vote that could reshape American transportation and energy systems.

The legislation allocates $200 billion for highway and bridge repairs, $150 billion for public transit, and $150 billion for renewable energy infrastructure. It marks the largest federal infrastructure investment since the 1950s.

"This is a historic moment for American infrastructure," said Sen. Jane Smith (D-Calif.), who co-authored the bill. "We're finally investing in the foundation of our economy."

The bill now moves to the House of Representatives, where it faces an uncertain future. House Speaker John Doe (R-Texas) said Tuesday he would bring it to a vote "in due time."

If signed into law, the package would create an estimated 2 million jobs over the next decade and modernize critical transportation networks across all 50 states.
